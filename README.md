# pi-server

# a pretty cool api based vm manager for rpi 5 

built for my own use prob with some major adjustments would work in production.

# setup 
- clone the repo
- install python and python3-pip
- do pip install fastapi
- then sudo apt install qemu-system libvirt-clients libvirt-daemon-system virt-manager
- then run the slave or the master depending on what machine it is
- or even better create a systemctl service on boot
